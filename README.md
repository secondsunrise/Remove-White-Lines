# Remove-White-Lines
**white-line-remover** is a small script that reads in a file with formatting errors for emails separated by new lines and blank new lines. It might look something like this:

```
someone@example.com
someone@example.com

someone@example.com
someone@example.com
someone@example.com

someone@example.com

someone@example.com
```
